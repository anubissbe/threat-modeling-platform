   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Write/update tests** for your changes

4. **Run tests locally**:
   ```bash
   make test
   make lint
   ```

5. **Commit your changes** using conventional commits

6. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Open a Pull Request** from your fork to our `main` branch

- Detailed description of the proposed functionality
- Rationale for why this enhancement would be useful
- Possible implementation approach

Use the [Feature Request Template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md).

### üìù Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? Look for issues labeled:

- `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Extra attention needed
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements

### üîÑ Pull Requests

1. **Ensure your PR**:
   - Solves one problem
   - Includes tests
   - Updates documentation
   - Follows code style guidelines
   - Has a clear description

2. **PR Title Format**:
   ```
   <type>(<scope>): <subject>
   ```
   Example: `feat(auth): add SAML SSO support`

3. **PR Description Template**:
   ```markdown
   ## Description
   Brief description of changes

   - [ ] New feature
   - [ ] Breaking change
   - [ ] Documentation update

   ## Testing

   ```

## Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/JavaScript

We use ESLint and Prettier. Run `make lint` to check your code.

```typescript
// Good
export const calculateRiskScore = (likelihood: number, impact: number): number => {
  return likelihood * impact;
};

// Bad
export function calculate_risk_score(l, i) {
  return l * i
}
```

### Python

We use Black and flake8. Run `make lint` in the AI service directory.

```python
# Good
def calculate_risk_score(likelihood: int, impact: int) -> float:
    """Calculate risk score based on likelihood and impact."""
    return likelihood * impact

# Bad
def CalculateRiskScore(l,i):
    return l*i
```

### React Components

Use functional components with TypeScript:

```tsx
// Good
interface ThreatCardProps {
  threat: Threat;
  onEdit: (id: string) => void;
}

export const ThreatCard: React.FC<ThreatCardProps> = ({ threat, onEdit }) => {
  return <div>{/* Component content */}</div>;
};
```

### API Design

Follow RESTful principles:

```
GET    /api/threats          # List threats
GET    /api/threats/:id      # Get threat
POST   /api/threats          # Create threat
PATCH  /api/threats/:id      # Update threat
DELETE /api/threats/:id      # Delete threat
```

## Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

### Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `build`: Build system changes
- `ci`: CI configuration changes
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

Closes #123
```

```
fix(threats): correct risk score calculation

The risk score was being calculated as likelihood + impact
instead of likelihood * impact.
```

## Testing

# Backend
cd backend/services/auth
npm test

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm test
```

### Integration Tests
