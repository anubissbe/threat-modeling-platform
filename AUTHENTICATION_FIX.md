# Authentication Fix Summary

## Issue
The frontend was stuck in an infinite authentication refresh loop due to:
1. Invalid/expired tokens in localStorage
2. Poor error handling that kept retrying failed refresh attempts
3. A workaround that completely disabled token storage

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Harmful Workaround
- Removed the code in `main.tsx` that was preventing ALL token storage
- This was causing authentication to never persist

### 2. Fixed Token Refresh Logic
- Added proper retry limits (MAX_REFRESH_ATTEMPTS = 1)
- Implemented mutex pattern to prevent simultaneous refresh attempts
- Skip refresh attempts for auth endpoints to prevent loops
- Clear tokens and redirect to login after refresh failure

### 3. Proper Error Handling
- Reset refresh attempt counter on successful requests
- Don't retry authentication endpoints
- Clear authentication state on refresh failure

## How to Clear Browser State
If you still see errors:

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab
3. Find Storage > Local Storage > http://localhost:3006
4. Right-click and "Clear"
5. Refresh the page

## Code Changes

### `/frontend/src/main.tsx`
- Removed localStorage override that prevented token storage

### `/frontend/src/services/api.ts`
- Added refresh attempt tracking with limit
- Implemented proper retry logic with mutex
- Skip auth endpoints from retry logic

### `/frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
- Fixed login to properly store tokens
- Implemented proper token refresh thunk
- Clear tokens on refresh failure

## Testing
The authentication now works correctly:
- Login stores tokens properly
- Token refresh attempts once on 401
- Failed refresh redirects to login
- No more infinite loops
