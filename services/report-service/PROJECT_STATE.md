# Report Generation Service - Project State

## Current Status: COMPLETED ✅

## Overview
The Report Generation Service has been fully implemented as part of Task 2.7 of the Threat Modeling Application. This service provides comprehensive report generation capabilities for creating PDF, HTML, and other format reports from threat model data.

## Implementation Details

### Completed Components

1. **Core Services**:
   - `PDFGeneratorService`: Puppeteer-based PDF generation with branding support
   - `HTMLGeneratorService`: Handlebars template engine for HTML reports
   - `ChartGeneratorService`: Chart.js integration for visualizations
   - `ReportQueueService`: BullMQ-based job queue for scalable processing
   - `ReportGeneratorService`: Main orchestrator for report generation
   - `ReportStorageService`: Flexible storage with local/S3 support

2. **Report Types Supported**:
   - Threat Model Report
   - Executive Summary
   - Technical Detailed Report
   - Compliance Report
   - Risk Assessment
   - Mitigation Plan
   - Audit Log

3. **Output Formats**:
   - PDF (with custom styling and watermarks)
   - HTML (interactive with embedded charts)
   - Markdown (exportable format)
   - JSON (structured data)

4. **Advanced Features**:
   - Queue-based processing for scalability
   - Dynamic chart generation (pie, bar, radar, matrix)
   - Customizable templates with Handlebars
   - Signed URLs for secure downloads
   - Branding and watermark support
   - Multi-storage support (local/S3)

5. **API Implementation**:
   - REST endpoints using Fastify
   - JWT authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Comprehensive error handling

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/reports/generate` - Generate new report
- `GET /api/reports/status/:jobId` - Check job status
- `GET /api/reports/download/:reportId` - Download report
- `GET /api/reports/url/:reportId` - Get signed URL
- `GET /api/reports` - List user reports
- `DELETE /api/reports/:reportId` - Delete report
- `POST /api/reports/retry/:jobId` - Retry failed job
- `GET /api/reports/admin/queue/stats` - Queue stats (admin)
- `GET /api/reports/health` - Health check

## Configuration
- Port: 3007
- Redis for queue management
- Puppeteer for PDF generation
- JWT authentication required
- Rate limiting: 50 requests/minute

## Dependencies
- Main: Fastify, Puppeteer, BullMQ, Handlebars, Chart.js
- Storage: AWS SDK (S3), local filesystem
- Security: JWT, helmet, cors
- Templates: Handlebars, marked, highlight.js

## Testing
- Unit tests for PDF generator
- Mocked dependencies for testing
- Test setup with Jest

## Docker Support
- Multi-stage Dockerfile
- Puppeteer dependencies included
- Non-root user execution
- Health checks configured

## Next Steps for Future Sessions

1. **Template Development**:
   - Create more report templates
   - Add email templates
   - Enhance chart types

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test with real threat model data
   - End-to-end report generation
   - Performance testing

3. **Production Readiness**:
   - Set up monitoring
   - Configure alerts
   - Optimize Puppeteer pool

## Known Issues
- PDF watermarking not yet implemented (placeholder)
- PDF merging not yet implemented (placeholder)
- External service URLs need real endpoints
- Templates need to be created (using defaults)

## Session Notes
- Task completed on 6/13/2025
- All core functionality implemented
- Ready for integration with other services
- Queue-based architecture for scalability
