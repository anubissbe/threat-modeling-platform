   - Environment configuration
   - Comprehensive logging

5. **Model Training**:
   - CLI tool for training models (`npm run train:all`)
   - Synthetic data generation
   - Model evaluation and reporting

#### Task 3.1: MLOps Infrastructure ✅
6. **Model Registry System**:
   - Model versioning and metadata management
   - Storage backend support (Local/S3/GCS)
   - Model promotion workflows (dev → staging → production)
   - Automated model validation and testing

7. **Advanced Model Serving**:
   - A/B testing capabilities with traffic splitting
   - Canary deployments for model rollouts
   - Multi-model serving with load balancing
   - Real-time inference with caching optimization

8. **Training Pipeline Orchestration**:
   - Automated training pipelines with MLflow integration
   - Experiment tracking and management
   - Feature store integration
   - Model performance monitoring

9. **Real-time Monitoring & Alerting**:
   - Model performance drift detection
   - Data quality monitoring with schema validation
   - Automated alerting system (Slack/Email/PagerDuty)
   - Comprehensive metrics collection (Prometheus)

10. **Feature Management**:
    - Feature flags for gradual rollout
    - Backward compatibility with legacy service
    - Configuration-driven model deployment
    - Environment-specific feature toggles
