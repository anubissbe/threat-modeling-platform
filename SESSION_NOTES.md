# Session Notes - Threat Modeling Application

## Session: 2025-06-13

### Work Completed
1. **Completed Task 1.1: System Architecture Design**
   - Created project directory structure at `/opt/projects/projects/threat-modeling-application/`
   - Designed and documented complete microservices architecture (14 services)
   - Designed API Gateway architecture using Kong
   - Designed Service Mesh architecture using Istio
   - Created comprehensive architecture overview
   - Enhanced architecture based on idea.md requirements:
     - Added TMAC (Threat Modeling as Code) Service with full DSL support
     - Created detailed Diagramming Service for DFD, attack trees, and collaboration
     - Designed Threat Libraries Service with OWASP, MITRE ATT&CK, CAPEC integration
     - Expanded Privacy Service with comprehensive LINDDUN support (GO, PRO, MAESTRO)

### Files Created
1. `/architecture/microservices-architecture.md` - Detailed microservices design (updated with 14 services)
2. `/architecture/api-gateway-architecture.md` - Kong gateway configuration
3. `/architecture/service-mesh-architecture.md` - Istio service mesh design
4. `/architecture/tmac-architecture.md` - Threat Modeling as Code architecture
5. `/architecture/diagramming-service-architecture.md` - Diagramming service design
6. `/architecture/threat-libraries-architecture.md` - Threat libraries management
7. `/architecture/privacy-architecture.md` - Privacy and LINDDUN support
8. `/architecture/README.md` - Overall architecture overview (updated)
9. `/README.md` - Project overview
10. `/TODO.md` - Task tracking
11. `/PROJECT_STATE.md` - Current project state
12. `/SESSION_NOTES.md` - This file

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Microservices Identified**: 14 services (expanded from initial 10)
   - Auth Service (Node.js)
   - User Management Service (Node.js)
   - Project Service (Node.js)
   - Threat Engine Service (Python)
   - AI/ML Service (Python)
   - Report Generation Service (Node.js)
   - Integration Service (Node.js)
   - Notification Service (Node.js)
   - Audit Service (Node.js)
   - Analytics Service (Python)
   - **TMAC Service (Node.js/TypeScript)** - NEW
   - **Diagramming Service (Node.js with D3.js)** - NEW
   - **Threat Libraries Service (Python)** - NEW
   - **Privacy Service (Python)** - NEW

2. **Technology Choices**:
   - Kong for API Gateway
   - Istio for Service Mesh
   - PostgreSQL with pgvector for primary storage
   - Redis for caching
   - RabbitMQ for messaging
   - Kubernetes for orchestration

3. **Architecture Patterns**:
   - Event-driven architecture
   - Domain-driven design
   - API-first approach
   - Database per service

### Next Session Tasks
1. Start Task 1.2: Database Schema Design
   - Design schemas for all services
   - Create ERD diagrams
   - Plan migration strategy
   
2. Set up local development environment
   - Create docker-compose.yml
   - Set up PostgreSQL with pgvector
   - Configure Redis

### Important Notes
- All architecture documentation is complete and ready for review
- No actual code has been written yet - still in design phase
- The project structure follows the MCP workspace standards
- Need to update the project-tasks MCP server with progress

### Commands for Next Session
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /opt/projects/projects/threat-modeling-application/

# Review architecture docs
ls architecture/

# Start database design
mkdir -p architecture/database
```

### Blockers/Issues
- None currently

### Time Spent
- Approximately 2 hours on architecture design and documentation
- Task 1.1 (16 hours allocated) appears to be completed faster than estimated

## Session: 2025-06-13 (Update)

### Task 2.2 Status Review
1. **User Management Service Progress**:
   - Core service implementation is complete (~60% of task)
   - Fastify-based service with comprehensive features
   - User CRUD operations fully implemented
   - RBAC system with roles and permissions working
   - Organization/multi-tenancy support implemented
   - Redis caching layer integrated
   - Advanced filtering and pagination complete
   - OpenAPI documentation in routes

2. **Remaining Work on Task 2.2** (~12 hours):
   - Unit tests needed (4 hours)
   - Integration tests needed (4 hours)
   - API documentation needed (2 hours)
   - Docker integration needed (2 hours)

3. **Key Implementation Details**:
   - Using Fastify instead of Express for better performance
   - PostgreSQL with proper schema isolation
   - Redis for caching with TTL
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Security middleware (auth, permissions)
   - Audit logging integrated

### Next Actions
1. Complete the 4 subtasks for Task 2.2
2. Then proceed to Task 2.3: Project Service

### Files Updated
- `/TODO.md` - Updated to reflect current progress on Task 2.2
- `/SESSION_NOTES.md` - This update
