## üîí Security Configuration Required

Before deployment, ensure these environment variables are set:

```bash
# Critical Security Settings
MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<32+ char random key>
SESSION_SECRET=<secure random secret>
JWT_SECRET=<secure random secret>
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<different secure secret>

# Database Security
DATABASE_SSL_MODE=require
ENCRYPTION_AT_REST_ENABLED=true

# Security Features
MFA_ENABLED=true
SECURITY_MONITORING_ENABLED=true
DETAILED_AUDIT_LOGGING=true
```

## üìä Security Metrics

Track these KPIs:
- Failed login attempts per hour
- Average response time for auth endpoints
- Number of blocked IPs
- Security events by severity
- Time to detect threats
- Time to respond to incidents
- Compliance audit pass rate
- Vulnerability remediation time
