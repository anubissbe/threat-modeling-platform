# Project: Threat Modeling Application

## Current Status
- Last worked on: 2025-06-15
- Current task: Setting up Docker development environment
- Branch: main
- Phase: Architecture Design & Initial Setup

## Completed Today
- ✅ Created comprehensive system architecture diagram
- ✅ Designed PostgreSQL database schema supporting multiple methodologies
- ✅ Created detailed database design documentation
- ✅ Defined REST API contracts with OpenAPI specification
- ✅ Created GraphQL schema for complex queries and subscriptions
- ✅ Set up Docker Compose for development environment
- ✅ Created Makefile for easy development workflow

## Key Insights from Requirements Analysis
1. **Scope**: Enterprise-grade threat modeling platform supporting multiple methodologies
2. **Core Value**: Transform threat modeling from manual, expert-driven to accessible, automated process
3. **Key Differentiators**:
   - Multi-methodology support (STRIDE, PASTA, LINDDUN, VAST, DREAD)
   - AI-powered threat suggestion and risk assessment
   - Threat Modeling as Code (TMAC) capabilities
   - Deep DevSecOps integration
   - Designed for non-security experts

## Architecture Decisions
- **Microservices**: For scalability and independent deployment
- **Plugin Architecture**: For methodology extensibility
- **Event-Driven**: For real-time collaboration
- **API-First**: RESTful + GraphQL for flexibility
- **Container-Native**: Docker/Kubernetes from the start

## Environment Setup
```bash
cd /opt/projects/projects/threat-modeling-app
# Technology stack chosen based on requirements
```

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Create system architecture diagram - COMPLETED
2. ✅ Design database schema supporting multiple methodologies - COMPLETED
3. ✅ Define API contracts for microservices - COMPLETED
4. ✅ Set up Docker development environment - COMPLETED
5. Initialize TypeScript project structure for each service
6. Implement auth service with JWT and SSO support
7. Create base React application with routing

## Important Context
- Document emphasizes "democratization" of threat modeling
- Must support both expert security professionals and developers
- Living threat models that evolve with the system
- Security of the tool itself is paramount (meta-threat modeling)

## Commands to Resume
```bash
cd /opt/projects/projects/threat-modeling-app
# Start development environment
make setup
make build
make up
```

## Architecture Deliverables Created

### 1. System Architecture (`docs/architecture/system-architecture.md`)
- Comprehensive microservices architecture diagram
- Service descriptions and responsibilities
- Technology stack decisions
- Security and scalability considerations

### 2. Database Schema (`docs/architecture/database-schema.sql`)
- Complete PostgreSQL schema with pgvector support
- Multi-methodology support via JSONB fields
- Row-level security for multi-tenancy
- Full-text search and performance indexes

### 3. API Specifications
- **REST API** (`docs/api/openapi-spec.yaml`): Complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- **GraphQL API** (`docs/api/graphql-schema.graphql`): Schema with queries, mutations, and subscriptions

### 4. Development Environment (`docker-compose.yml`)
- 12 containerized services ready to run
- PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, MinIO, RabbitMQ
- All microservices with hot-reload
- Monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana

## Technical Challenges Identified
1. Supporting diverse methodologies with single data model
2. AI integration for meaningful threat suggestions
3. Real-time collaboration at enterprise scale
4. TMAC implementation with version control
5. Balancing automation with human expertise

## Notes
- Requirements document is extremely comprehensive (946 lines)
- Strong emphasis on user experience and developer experience
- Multiple references to existing tools (IriusRisk, ThreatModeler, etc.)
- AI/ML features are expected, not optional
- Integration ecosystem is critical for adoption
