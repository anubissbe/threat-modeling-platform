# Project: Threat Modeling Application

## Current Status
- Last worked on: 2025-07-08
- Current task: Fixing missing services and verifying functionality
- Branch: main
- Phase: Infrastructure Setup & Service Implementation

## Project Overview
An enterprise-grade threat modeling platform supporting multiple methodologies (STRIDE, PASTA, LINDDUN, VAST, DREAD) with AI-powered features, designed for enterprise scalability and DevSecOps integration.

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Components

#### Infrastructure & Environment
- ‚úÖ Docker Compose development environment with all service definitions
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL database with pgvector support (running)
- ‚úÖ Redis cache (running)
- ‚úÖ Complete database schema supporting multiple methodologies
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions (standardized workflows)

#### Backend Services
- ‚úÖ **Auth Service** (Port 3001)
  - JWT authentication with refresh tokens
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Security monitoring and audit logging
  - Compliance service implementation
  - Currently running but showing token refresh errors
  
- ‚úÖ **AI Service** (Port 3003)
  - Comprehensive threat suggestion engine
  - Methodology-specific suggestions (STRIDE, PASTA, LINDDUN)
  - Threat analysis and scoring
  - Pattern recognition
  - Full implementation with tests

- ‚úÖ **API Gateway** (Port 3000)
  - Just created with proper routing configuration
  - Proxies to all microservices
  - Health check endpoints
  - Error handling and logging

#### Frontend Application
- ‚úÖ React + TypeScript setup with Vite
- ‚úÖ Material-UI component library
- ‚úÖ Redux state management
- ‚úÖ Authentication flow with protected routes
- ‚úÖ Pages implemented:
  - Login page with JWT integration
  - Dashboard with metrics
  - Projects management
  - Threat Models listing
  - Threat Model Editor (visual drag-and-drop)
- ‚úÖ Testing setup with Vitest and React Testing Library

#### Testing & Quality
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test suite (claimed 90%+ coverage)
- ‚úÖ ESLint and Prettier configuration
- ‚úÖ TypeScript strict mode
- ‚úÖ Security hardening implemented

### ‚ùå Incomplete/Missing Components

#### Backend Services
- ‚ùå **Core Service** (Port 3002) - Directory exists but no implementation
- ‚ùå **Diagram Service** (Port 3004) - Empty directory
- ‚ùå **Report Service** (Port 3005) - No Dockerfile
- ‚ùå **Integration Service** - Empty directory
- ‚ùå **Notification Service** - Empty directory
- ‚ùå **Threat Engine Service** - Partial implementation

#### Infrastructure Services
- ‚ùå Elasticsearch - Not running
- ‚ùå MinIO - Not running
- ‚ùå RabbitMQ - Not running
- ‚ùå Prometheus/Grafana monitoring stack - Not running
- ‚ùå Adminer database UI - Not running

### üîß Current Issues

1. **Service Implementation**: Most backend services have directory structure but lack actual implementation
2. **Auth Service Health**: Running but unhealthy due to JWT token refresh errors
3. **Missing Dockerfiles**: Several services missing Dockerfile configurations
4. **Services Not Running**: Only 3 out of 16 defined services are running
5. **Frontend Not Containerized**: Frontend runs in development mode, not as a container

## Key Architecture Decisions
- **Microservices**: For scalability and independent deployment
- **Plugin Architecture**: For methodology extensibility
- **Event-Driven**: For real-time collaboration
- **API-First**: RESTful + GraphQL for flexibility
- **Container-Native**: Docker/Kubernetes from the start

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js with TypeScript (microservices)
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript + Vite
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector + Redis
- **AI/ML**: Python services (planned)
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ (not yet running)
- **Container**: Docker + Kubernetes (planned)
- **API**: RESTful (implemented) + GraphQL (planned)
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens

## Next Priority Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. ‚úÖ Create missing API Gateway service
2. ‚è≥ Fix Auth Service JWT token refresh issue
3. ‚è≥ Implement Core Service (projects, threat models, threats APIs)
4. ‚è≥ Implement Diagram Service for DFD editor backend
5. ‚è≥ Implement Report Service for report generation
6. ‚è≥ Start all infrastructure services (Elasticsearch, MinIO, RabbitMQ)
7. ‚è≥ Deploy and test full application stack

### Future Features
1. Real-time collaboration with WebSockets
2. TMAC (Threat Modeling as Code) implementation
3. External integrations (Jira, Azure DevOps, CI/CD)
4. Advanced AI/ML threat prediction models
5. Kubernetes deployment manifests
6. Production hardening and optimization

## Commands to Resume
```bash
cd /opt/projects/threat-modeling-platform

# Start infrastructure services
docker-compose up -d postgres redis

# Start application services (after implementation)
docker-compose up -d

# Frontend development
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev

# Check service health
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}"
```

## Session Notes

### 2025-07-08
- Created missing API Gateway service with full implementation
- Analyzed current state: Only 3/16 services running
- Most backend services have directory structure but no implementation
- Frontend is fully implemented but not containerized
- Need to implement remaining backend services to have functional application
