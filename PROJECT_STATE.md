## Technical Decisions

### Technology Stack Confirmed
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, Python with FastAPI
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL 15, Redis 7, pgvector, ClickHouse
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, Istio
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

### Architecture Patterns
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Event-Driven Architecture
- API-First Development
- Database per Service
- Saga Pattern for distributed transactions

## Risks and Blockers
- No current blockers
- Need to ensure all team members understand the architecture
- Database design will be critical for performance

## Environment Status
- Development: Not set up
- Staging: Not set up
- Production: Not set up

## Team Notes
- Architecture review meeting needed before proceeding to implementation
- Need to establish coding standards and conventions
- CI/CD pipeline design required in Phase 1.5

## Session Continuity
To continue work:
1. Navigate to `/opt/projects/projects/threat-modeling-application/`
2. Review completed services in `/services/` directory
3. Start with Task 3.1: AI Service Setup (Phase 3)
4. Use the TODO.md file to track progress
5. All Phase 2 services are ready for integration testing

## Dependencies
- Docker and Docker Compose for local development
- Access to Kubernetes cluster for deployment
- PostgreSQL 15 with pgvector extension
- Redis 7 for caching
- Kong and Istio for infrastructure
