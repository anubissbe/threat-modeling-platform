- ✅ TypeScript strict mode
- ✅ Security hardening implemented

### ❌ Incomplete/Missing Components

#### Backend Services  
- ✅ **AI Service** (Port 3003) - OPERATIONAL
  - Complete TypeScript implementation with threat analysis capabilities
  - AI-powered threat suggestions and risk assessment
  - Authentication middleware and rate limiting
  - Database integration for threat intelligence storage
  - Docker containerization with health checks
  - Successfully deployed and integrated with API Gateway
- ✅ **Report Service** (Port 3005) - OPERATIONAL
  - Complete TypeScript implementation with HTML, JSON, PDF generation
  - CRUD operations for report management  
  - Docker containerization with health checks
  - Rate limiting and security middleware
  - Database integration with JSONB content storage
  - Minor schema compatibility issues (easily fixable)
- ❌ **Integration Service** - Empty directory
- ❌ **Notification Service** - Empty directory
- ❌ **Threat Engine Service** - Partial implementation

#### Infrastructure Services
- ✅ **PostgreSQL** - Running and healthy (primary database with pgvector)
- ✅ **Redis** - Running and healthy (caching and session storage)
- ✅ **RabbitMQ** - Running and healthy (message queuing)
- ✅ **MinIO** - Running and healthy (object storage for reports/files)
- ✅ **Elasticsearch** - Running and healthy (search functionality)
- ✅ **Prometheus** - Running and healthy (metrics collection)
- ✅ **Grafana** - Running and healthy (monitoring dashboards)
- ✅ **Adminer** - Running and healthy (database management UI)

### ✅ Issues Resolved & ⚠️ Remaining

#### ✅ Major Issues Fixed
1. **Core Services Implemented**: Auth Service, Core Service, Diagram Service, and API Gateway now fully operational
2. **Database Initialized**: Complete schema with 21 tables properly created and connected
3. **Service Communication**: API Gateway properly routing requests to all backend services
4. **Container Architecture**: All core services properly containerized and healthy
5. **Visual Diagram Support**: Diagram Service with DFD editor, canvas rendering, and export capabilities

#### ⚠️ Issues Remaining  
1. **Auth Service JWT Refresh**: Minor token refresh warnings (service still functional)
2. **Missing Services**: Report, AI services not yet deployed
3. **Infrastructure Services**: Elasticsearch, MinIO not started (optional for core functionality)
4. **Frontend**: Not containerized, runs in development mode

## Key Architecture Decisions
- **Microservices**: For scalability and independent deployment
- **Plugin Architecture**: For methodology extensibility
- **Event-Driven**: For real-time collaboration
- **API-First**: RESTful + GraphQL for flexibility
- **Container-Native**: Docker/Kubernetes from the start

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js with TypeScript (microservices)
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript + Vite
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector + Redis
- **AI/ML**: Python services (planned)
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ (not yet running)
- **Container**: Docker + Kubernetes (planned)
- **API**: RESTful (implemented) + GraphQL (planned)
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens

## Next Priority Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. ✅ Create missing API Gateway service - COMPLETED
2. ✅ Implement Core Service (projects, threat models, threats APIs) - COMPLETED  
3. ✅ Initialize database with full schema - COMPLETED
4. ✅ Implement Diagram Service for DFD editor backend - COMPLETED
5. ✅ Implement Report Service for report generation - COMPLETED
6. ⏳ Fix Auth Service JWT token refresh issue - Low priority, service functional
7. ⏳ Start all infrastructure services (Elasticsearch, MinIO, RabbitMQ)
8. ⏳ Deploy and test full application stack

### Future Features
1. Real-time collaboration with WebSockets
2. TMAC (Threat Modeling as Code) implementation
3. External integrations (Jira, Azure DevOps, CI/CD)
4. Advanced AI/ML threat prediction models
5. Kubernetes deployment manifests
6. Production hardening and optimization

## Commands to Resume
```bash
cd /opt/projects/threat-modeling-platform

# Start infrastructure services
docker-compose up -d postgres redis

# Start application services (after implementation)
docker-compose up -d

# Frontend development
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev

# Check service health
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}"
```

## Session Notes

### 2025-07-08
- Created missing API Gateway service with full implementation
- Analyzed current state: Only 3/16 services running
- Most backend services have directory structure but no implementation
- Frontend is fully implemented but not containerized
- Need to implement remaining backend services to have functional application
